//Approach 
1.sort based on start time or end time (mostly start time)->direct normally sort(a.begin(),a.end())
2.overlap condition check ->[cs,ce](i) ,  [ns,ne](j)
  if(ce>ns) //overlap [1,4] [2,7 ] (here delete 2,7)
  //then check kissko delete krrna h [cs,ce] issko or [ns,ne]
  //delete that interval jisska end greater h because more overlaps ussme ho skte
  //if(ce>ne) delete ce thatis i=j;j++;
  else  delete ne thatis j++;

3.non-overlap then easy inc i=j,j++;
